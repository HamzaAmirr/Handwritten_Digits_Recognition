The file "Hand Written digits (0-9) classification" contains detailing all preprocessing steps and the model code used.

The Dataset used is MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)

Summary of the dataset:

  * Content: The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset contains images of handwritten digits.
  * Categories: The dataset includes 10 classes, one for each digit from 0 to 9.
  * Image Dimensions: Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale.
  * Training and Test Sets: The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
  * Purpose: MNIST is a benchmark dataset used extensively in the field of machine learning and computer vision for testing and evaluating various algorithms and models for digit recognition.
  * Usage: It is commonly used for tasks such as image classification, model benchmarking, and algorithm development in Machine and Deep Learning.
